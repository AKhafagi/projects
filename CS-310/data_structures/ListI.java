 * This interface provides stipulations on what you must implement,
 * and what they are called. The interface includes methods
 * for adding and removing elements. Efficient methods should be 
 * provided for determining if the list is empty, and for 
 * determining the current size of the list. Methods for determining
 * whether the list is full will depend on the implementation, but
 * should be efficiently encoded.
